Wish List for at_cascade
########################

avgint Table
************
Document the state of the ``dismod_at.db`` avgint table at the end of
:ref:`fit_one_job-name` .
(Note that the avgint table in ``ancestor.db`` and ``this.db``
are different; see :ref:`wish_list@csv.fit@avgint Table` below.)

csv.fit
*******

avgint Table
============
Document the state of the avgint table in
``ancestor.db`` and ``this.db`` at the end of :ref:`csv.pre_one_job-name` .
These are the dismod_at databases used by :ref:`csv.predict-name`
to predict using the prior and posterior distributions respectively.

Measurement Value Covariate
===========================
Currently :ref:`csv.fit-name` automatically creates an
absolute covariate called ``one`` .
If we also automatically created a covariate
called ``meas_value`` , we could use it with a meas_value
covariate multiplier to expand or contract measurements values.

Prediction Grid
===============
It would be good to specify a prediction grid that may be different from
the covariate age-time grid.

.. _rate_eff_cov: https://dismod-at.readthedocs.io/latest/rate_eff_cov_table.html

covariate.csv
=============
The `rate_eff_cov`_ table is a dismod_at quick fix that attaches
covariate functions to locations,
instead of covariate values to data points.
This may use a lot of memory and take a while to set up; i.e.,
slow down each run of dismod_at.
On the other hand, there is only one copy of this table
for each cascade (in the :ref:`glossary@root_database` )
so it should not use a lot of disk space.
One partial solution would be to not put all the nodes in the
:ref:`csv.simulate@Input Files@covariate.csv` file.
We could use the closest ancestor's covariate and omega values
when a node is not in covariate.csv.

Duration
********
Calculate average duration for incident cases given future remission and
mortality trends. See the equation for duration as a function of age and
time from his DisMod III book, section 8.2  in
:ref:`bib@Flaxman et al. (2015)`. And the definition of duration given with
equations in :ref:`bib@Barendregt et al. (2003)`.

max_fit
*******
Add an option to ignore the :ref:`csv.fit@Input Files@option_fit.csv@max_fit`
option when fitting a leaf node; i.e., a node that has no children. This is
actually for leaf jobs not leaf nodes in the special case where the splitting
covariate is split at a leaf node.
On the other hand, perhaps the node tree should be extended so that
leaf nodes with lots of data are split into sub-nodes.

ode_step_size
*************
Want to be able to use a bigger ode step size when there is a shock
or other rapid change for a particular age or time.
