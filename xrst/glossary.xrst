chi
***
The model rate for excess mortality as a function of age and time.
This is also denoted by :math:`\chi(a, t)`.

child jobs
**********
#. If :ref:`option_all_table@refit_split` is false,
   there is one child job for each child node of the current
   :ref:`glossary@fit_node` .
#. If :ref:`option_all_table@refit_split` is true,
   and the current fit_node is **not** in the :ref:`node_split_table-name` ,
   there is one child job for each child node of the current
   :ref:`glossary@fit_node` .
#. If :ref:`option_all_table@refit_split` is true,
   and the current fit_node is in the :ref:`node_split_table-name` ,
   the child jobs have the same fit_node and there is one job for each
   :ref:`split_reference_table@split_reference_value`
   that is not equal to the current job's split_reference value.

dage
****
The abbreviation *dage* is used for differences of a function value
with rest to age values.
These are differences and not derivative approximations.

dtime
*****
The abbreviation *dtime* is used for finite differences of a function value
with rest to time values.
These are differences and not derivative approximations.

eta
***
This is an offset in a log transformation; i.e., a mapping of the form
:math:`x \rightarrow \log(x + \eta )`.
Note that this transformation is finite valued at :math:`x` equal to zero.

fit_goal_set
************
This is the set of nodes that we need a fit for.
It must be a subset (which could be all) of the
:ref:`fit_goal_table-name` .

fit_node
********
For a dismod_at database, *fit_node* is
the parent node in the dismod_at option table.

fit_node_set
************
This is the set of nodes that need to be fit in order to fit the
:ref:`glossary@fit_goal_set`.
This includes all the nodes between the root node and the goal nodes
(including the root node and he goal nodes).

fit_database
************
This is a dismod_at database with the following properties:

Constant Tables
===============
see :ref:`module@at_cascade.constant_table_list`.

Option Table
============
The *fit_database* option table is the same as in the
*root_database* except for the value of *parent_node_name*.
This node is called the fit_node for the database.
The value of *parent_node_id* does not appear in the option table.

Covariate Table
===============
For each :ref:`glossary@Relative Covariate`,
the covariate table reference value is the average returned by
:ref:`com_cov_reference-name` for this node and split_reference_id.
The split covariate reference value is one of the
:ref:`split_reference_table@split_reference_value`
in the split_reference table.
The other columns in the covariate table are the same
as in the root_database.

Fixed Effects Smoothings
========================
The age and time points corresponding to the smoothing for the
parent rates (except omega)
and the covariate multipliers are the same as in the *root_database*.
In addition, the age and time difference prior corresponding to each
age and time point is the same as in the *root_database*.

Random Effects Smoothing
========================
The smoothing for the child rates (except omega) are the same as in the
*root_database*.

Rate Table
==========
The rate table smoothing for pini must be null or the corresponding
smooth_grid entries must use the age_id corresponding to the smallest
age in the age table.

Integrand Table
===============
For the list of rates [ pini, iota, rho, chi ]
the corresponding integrand names are
[ prevalence, Sincidence, remission, mtexcess ].
If the parent_smooth_id in the rate table for one of these rates is
not null, the corresponding integrand name must be in the integrand table.
For each value covariate multiplier index *mulcov_id*, the integrand name
``mulcov_``\ *mulcov_id* must be in the integrand table.

input_node_database
*******************
This is a fit_database with the following extra properties:

Input Tables
============
Only the dismod_at input tables are significant in a fit_databases;
e.g., an init command should be executed before any other dismod_at
commands (except possibly a set command).

nslist Table
============
The nslist and nslist_pair tables must be empty.

avgint Table
============
The avgint table must be empty.

Rate Table
==========
The rate table must have null entries for the
omega parent and child smoothings.

iota
****
The model rate for incidence,
relative to the susceptible population, as a function of age and time.
This is also denoted by :math:`\iota(a, t)`.

job
***
A job corresponds to one row of the :ref:`create_job_table@job_table`; i.e.,
one fit node and split_reference_id.
The results for a job is its fit and the value priors for its
:ref:`glossary@child jobs` ;
see :ref:`create_job_table@job_table@start_child_job_id` and
*end_child_job_id*\ .

meas_noise
**********
The abbreviation used for measurement noise covariate multiplier.

mtall
*****
The abbreviation used for all cause mortality data.

mtexcess
********
The abbreviation used for excess mortality data.

mtother
*******
The abbreviation used for other cause mortality data.

mtspecific
**********
The abbreviation used for cause specific mortality data.

node_name
*********
Is the *node_name* for a node in the *root_database* node table.

node_split_set
**************
This is the set of nodes at which the cascade is split by the value
of the splitting covariate.
No node in this set can be a descendant (or ancestor) of another
node in this set.
(Becasue the splitting can only occur once in the path from the
*root_node* to any other node.)

ode_integrand
*************
The following integrands requires solving the dismod_at ode to model
and hence each of them is called an *ode_integrand*:
susceptible, withC, prevalence, Tprevalence, mtspecific, mtall, mtstandard.

omega
*****
The model rate for other cause mortality as a function of age and time.
This is also denoted by :math:`\omega(a, t)`.
Note that omega a a special rate because it is know ahead of time; see
:ref:`omega_all-name` .

omega_grid
**********
A single age-time grid used for the *omega* constraints.

pini
****
The initial prevalence as a function of time.
If the initial age is zero, time is *t* , and prevalence is *p*,
then pini is the function :math:`p(0,t)` .
This often referred to as a rate because it can be estimated and
is an input to the dismod_at ordinary differential equation,
like the other rates in the dismod_at model.

prevalence
**********
This is the ratio the number of people with the condition
divided by the number of people currently alive.

rate_value
**********
The abbreviation used for rate value covariate multiplier.

Relative Covariate
******************
A relative covariate is any covariate that is not an
:ref:`absolute covariate<option_all_table@absolute_covariates>`
and is not the splitting covariate
(which is specified by the
:ref:`option_all_table@split_covariate_name`).
The reference value for a relative covariate can depend on the node
and the value of the splitting covariate.

remission
*********
The abbreviation used for the remission integrand.
This corresponds to a directly measurement of *rho*

rho
***
The mode rate for remission as a function of age an time.
This is also denoted by :math:`\rho(a, t)`.

root_node
*********
The top level node for this cascade; see
:ref:`option_all_table@root_node_name`.

root_database
*************
This is a dismod_at database where the *root_node* is the
parent node in the dismod_at option table.
It must satisfy all the conditions for an
:ref:`glossary@input_node_database` plus the following:

#. The subgroup table must have one row; i.e., there is one subgroup,
   one group and they correspond to all the nodes.
#. The option table must not have an
   *other_database* or *other_input_table* entry.

Sincidence
**********
The abbreviation used for the susceptible incidence integrand.
This corresponds to a directly measurement of :ref:`glossary@iota`.

top_directory
*************
Directory where the input data is located.
