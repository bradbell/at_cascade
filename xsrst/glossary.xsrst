Glossary
########

eta
***
This is an offset in a log transformation; i.e., a mapping of the form
:math:`x \rightarrow \log(x + \eta )`.
Note that this transformation is finite valued at :math:`x` equal to zero.


fit_node
********
For a dismod_at run, *fit_node* is
the parent node in the dismod_at option table.

in_parallel
***********
If *in_parallel* is true nodes at the same level are fit in parallel.
Here fitting a node includes fitting its child nodes that are required
by the *leaf_node_set*.
If *in_parallel* is false, the fitting will be done sequentially.
This should be easier to debug and should give the same results.

iota
****
The model rate for incidence,
relative to the susceptible population, as a function of age and time.
This is also denoted by :math:`\iota(a, t)`.

leaf_node_set
*************
This is the set of nodes below *root_node* that will be fit.
Note that all the nodes between the root node and the leaf nodes
will also be fit.

meas_noise
**********
The abbreviation used for measurement noise covariate multiplier.

min_interval
************
This is the minimum age or time interval size.
Age (time) intervals in the data file that are smaller than this size
will be approximated by the interval midpoint value.

mtall
*****
The abbreviation used for all cause mortality data.

mtother
*******
The abbreviation used for Other cause mortality data.

mtspecific
**********
The abbreviation used for cause specific mortality data.

ode_integrand
**************
The following integrands requires solving the dismod_at ode to model
and hence each of them is called an *ode_integrand*:
susceptible, withC, prevalence, Tprevalence, mtspecific, mtall, mtstandard.

omega
*****
The model rate for other cause mortality as a function of age and time.
This is also denoted by :math:`\omega(a, t)`.

omega_grid
**********
A single age-time grid used for the *omega* constraints.

rate_value
**********
The abbreviation used for rate value covariate multiplier.

root_node
*********
The top level node for this cascade.

root_node_database
******************
This is a database that contains information for all the nodes; see
:ref:`plan.input_data.root_node_database`.

sex_level
*********
Level below the *root_node* where the cascade splits by sex.

Sincidence
**********
The abbreviation used for the susceptible incidence integrand.
This corresponds to a directly measurement of :ref:`glossary.iota`.

top_directory
*************
Directory where the input data is located.
